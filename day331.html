        <h2>Day 331</h2>
        <p>
            Took one of the fools out for a ride to the comms tower.
Pushed them out of the airlock onto the roof with no
vaccsuit. Loved the look on their face. Managed to
override the comms system and lock the whole tower up.
Canâ€™t go asking for help to mommy now, hehehe...
