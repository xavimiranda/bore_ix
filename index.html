        <h2>Day 112</h2>
        <p>Oh shit! Something is really off with the air of this
            place. Went on a mission to fix the antenna at the comms
            tower. Lionel punctured his vaccsuit. Then, something
            happened.. His eyes went pitch black and he started
            chewing this terrible blue froth, growing black spikes
            from his body. He attacked me while howling like a madman!
            Had to put a bullet between his eyes. Fuck!</p>
